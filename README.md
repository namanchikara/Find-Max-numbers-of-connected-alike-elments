# Find-Max-numbers-of-connected-alike-elments

Given a N x M 2D array of various values (repeatable), this program will return maximum value of connected components with same values.

For example:

We have an array of 5 rows and (M) columns in each row (Program is flexible so that M can vary, i.e for each row-> number of columns could vary.

1 0 1 2 2 2 2 1 1
1 0 1 1 2 2
1 1 1 2 2 2 2 1

Maximum connected component in above matrix is 2, with 10 values, so the program will return 10 on executing FindMaxNow().
